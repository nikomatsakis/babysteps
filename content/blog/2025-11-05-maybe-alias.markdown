Hmm, as I re-read the post I literally *just* posted a few minutes ago, I got to thinking. Maybe the right name is indeed `Alias`, and not `Share`. The rationale is simple: alias can serve as both a noun and a verb. It hits that sweet spot of "common enough you know what it means, but weird enough that it can be Rust Jargon for something quite specific". In the same way that we talk about "passing a clone of `foo`" we can talk about "passing an alias to `foo`" or an "alias of `foo`". Food for thought! I'm going to try `Alias` on for size in future posts and see how it feels.
