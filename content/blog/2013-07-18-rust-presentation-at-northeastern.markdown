Today I had the honor of giving a presentation on Rust at the
Northeastern University PL Seminar. It was a lot of fun, and I also
had a lot of good conversations afterwards with some of the professors
and PhD students there. For those who are interested, I am uploading
the [slides from my talk][slides].  The talk takes the same approach
that I would like to use for the next Rust paper. It was kind of a dry
run to see if that approach would be understandable and would flow logically;
overall, I thought it worked reasonably well.
