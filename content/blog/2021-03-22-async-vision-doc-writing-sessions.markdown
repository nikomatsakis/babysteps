title: Async Vision Doc Writing Sessions
---

Hey folks! As part of the [Async Vision Doc] effort, 
I'm planning on holding two public drafting sessions tomorrow, March 23rd:

* March 23rd at noon ET ([click to see in your local timezone][noon])
* March 23rd at 5pm ET ([click to see in your local tomezone][5pm])

During these sessions, we'll be looking over the [status quo issues][sqi]
and writing a story or two! If you'd like to join, ping me on Discord 
or Zulip and I'll send you the Zoom link.

### The vision...what?

Never heard of the async vision doc? It's a new thing we're trying as part of the Async Foundations Working Group:

> We are launching a collaborative effort to build a shared [vision document][vd] for Async Rust. **Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:** how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a _joyful_ one?
