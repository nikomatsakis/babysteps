If you visit the site today, you'll notice it looks quite a bit
different.  I've decided to switch from my old antiquated Octopress to
a plain Jekyll-based one. The most immediate of this is that Rust code
highlighting looks much better, and I get access to modern
Github-flavored markdown. =) Since I understand plain Jekyll a bit
more, I'll hopefully also be able to customize the appearance somewhat
-- but for now I'm just going with the basic theme.

If I've done everything right -- unlikely -- then all the old links
will still work. Let me know if you notice anything amiss!
