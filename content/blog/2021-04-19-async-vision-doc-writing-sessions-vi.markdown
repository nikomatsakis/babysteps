Ryan Levick and I are going to be hosting more Async Vision Doc Writing Sessions this week. We're not organized enough to have assigned topics yet, so I'm just going to post the dates/times and we'll be tweeting about the particular topics as we go.

If you've joined before, we'll be re-using the same Zoom link. If you haven't joined, then send a private message to one of us and we'll share the link. Hope to see you there!
