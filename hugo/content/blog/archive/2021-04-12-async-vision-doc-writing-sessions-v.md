title: Async Vision Doc Writing Sessions V
---

This is an exciting week for the vision doc! As of this week, we are starting to
draft "shiny future" stories, and we would like your help! (We are also still
working on status quo stories, so there is no need to stop working on those.)
There will be a blog post coming out on the main Rust blog soon with all the
details, but you can go to the ["How to vision: Shiny future"] page now.

This week, Ryan Levick and I are going to be hosting four Async
Vision Doc Writing Sessions. Here is the schedule:

| When | Who | Topic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Wed at 07:00 ET] | Ryan | TBD |
| [Wed at 15:00 ET] | Niko | Shiny future -- [Niklaus simulates hydrodynamics] |
| [Fri at 07:00 ET] | Ryan | TBD |
| [Fri at 14:00 ET] | Niko | Shiny future -- [Portability across runtimes] |

The idea for shiny future is to start by looking at the existing stories we 
have and to imagine how they might go differently. To be quite honest,
I am not entirely how this is going to work, but we'll figure it out together.
It's going to be fun. =) Come join!
